## Measuring ISS speed from photos or videos of Earth taken from the ISS
One way to measure the speed of the ISS from photos or videos is to use image tracking techniques. 
This involves detecting and tracking features in the images, and then using the position of those features over time to calculate the speed of the ISS. 
The speed can be calculated by determining the displacement of the features between consecutive frames of the video or between two consecutive photos, and then dividing that displacement by the time elapsed between the frames or photos.
